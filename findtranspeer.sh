# check the servdir for iplists created by own daemons
# go through these lists looking for transpeers

# use wget to check the ip for a downloadable file. look for the hello file. then get listing file.
# parse the file for available files from the server
# download the individual files (store them in array and loop over array)

# Then we have a bunch of new iplist files. Store them in the servdir I guess?
