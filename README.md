Oh, whattaya know?!?! MORE BASH! 

This time I actually think there's a reason besides my inability to learn C++... 
this makes it relatively easy to run with a bunch of other daemons as an overlay thing maybe. 
Cross compatability, because all you gotta do is write a bash script to dump a daemons p2p list to a file. 

[A narrative was provided here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/f6y8xn/ccs_idea_maybe_someone_can_write_it_up/)

But basically, we create a common protocol for p2p networks to share their IP lists with each other,
such that a brute force of IP space is more likely to yield a connection that can provide IP lists of potential peers.
